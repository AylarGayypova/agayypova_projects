## Welcome! This repository is mainly for my work on anisotropy. 

## Please find the descriptions of folders/files contained below: 
* Summer_Solar_Dipole:
  - 1DProjAmplitude&Phase file contains the 1D projections of Amplitude from the solar dipole skymaps fitted into a cosine function. It also includes the projections with expected amplitudes of skymaps based on the Compton-Getting Effect.
  - 2dSolar_Dipole file contains the code that makes the residual solar dipole maps by taking the sidereal signal for each month and subtracting all the data from it
  - GIFofSolarDipole the gif files that combines all the monthly solar dipole skymaps
  - OrbitalSpeed file contains the code that makes skymaps due to Compton-getting effect using Earth's barycentric velocity from astopy function of python
